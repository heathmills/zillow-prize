    "In the United States, prospective first-time homebuyers are embarking on one of the largest financial decisions of their lives. As stated on the Zillow Prize homepage:\n",

    ">A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zillow created the Zestimate in 2006 and has become one of the primary tools for prospective homeowners to browse and shop the market in their area. The Zestimate uses statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on every property in the country to develop an estimated home value for every house in the nation. The Zestimate was the first type of home value information at no cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a newly married man, I am looking at becoming a homeowner over the next 6-12 months so the opportunity to learn more about the housing market was too good to pass up. I am using this project to create my entry in the 1st Round of the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first round of the competition, Zillow is asking entrants to **predict the mean absolute error (MAE) of the provided Zestimate for homes sold in three California counties (LA, Orange, and Ventura) during the evaluation period (October 17, 2017 â€“ December 15, 2017).**"

    "1. Any information gleaned from the housing data for LA, Orange & Venura counties in California are representative of the overall U.S. housing market\n",
    "2. The training sets provided from 2016 and 2017 contain a large enough sample size\n",
    "3. The data provided by Zillow contains all of the statistics that were used by Zillow to predict calculate the version of the Zestimate that will be used for scoring the first round of the competition."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "1. I have less knowledge of working with time-based sets so I will not be able to vary my predictions from month to month.\n",
    "2. The 2017 data was not released until 10/2/17 and I am presenting this on project on 10/5/17 so my time was extremely limited.\n",
    "3. The course only covered neural networks briefly in the final two lectures, so I utilize outside sources for more information in developing my final predictions."
